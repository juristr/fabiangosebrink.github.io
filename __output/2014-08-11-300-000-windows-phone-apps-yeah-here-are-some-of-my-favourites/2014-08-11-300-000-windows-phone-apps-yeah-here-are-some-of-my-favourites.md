I have just read on Winfuture ([Article](http://winfuture.de/news,83056.html)) that Microsoft (by the) Numbers just released the number 300.000 regarding to the apps in the Microsoft Store for Windows Phone.

_Statista_ is saying something else [here](http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/208599/umfrage/anzahl-der-apps-in-den-top-app-stores/) at the timepoint of 11.08.2014:

![alttext]({{site.baseurl}}assets/images/blogs/2014-08/cf8bfa23-753f-4194-952f-8cd8519d2cd1.jpg)

But this is taking the data from july and is perhaps not that reliable as Microsoft itself (or is it vice versa?)

No, I am very sure this number 300.000 is realistic and I am very happy about this. I am a Windows Phone from the very first beginning and I never was happier with a phone.

Before I get a real discussion going here: I once had a Android-Phone. It was working though. But there was one thing which was really getting me nuts: All the settings or additional features to an app were hid in a different location in every app. I mean: Sometimes you had to slide from the left to the right, from the top to the bottom, sometimes the Hardware-&#8220;Button&#8221; had to be touched, sometimes you had to push a button and so on. There was no general way. This is why I also believe I would get along with an iPhone. On WP and IOs every app (and the menu) looks quite the same without loosing its own flavour and look-and-feel. I love this. It is nearly impossible for me to know the handling of an app on android off pat. WP (for sure) and IOs (quite sure ðŸ˜‰ ) give me the feeling that I do not have to get warm with an app before using it. But this is only my opinion.

As this blogpost is about Windows Phone Apps I want to come back to this. You can read everything about the 300.000 apps and the release and development-speed and so on in the article.

Some of the maybe most important apps **for me** are:

](http://www.whatsapp.com/?l=de) &#8211; Does not need an explanation. Is a Message Service and also able to send images, recordings and so on. Belongs to Facebook and I think this was the point where everybody interested on Apps and Phones heard of WhatsApp at the latest.

<a href="http://7pass.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">7Pass </a>&#8211; An app to manage all my passwords. Is also running on all my PCs and my Surface.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.imploded.com/products/currency-converter-for-windows-phone/" target="_blank">Currency Converter</a> &#8211; Very important on vacation or in case you are living in another country

Gives you one button to press when you are hungry. You can select up to 6 restaurants the app should show you nearby. This app also navigates you to the selected one.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://metrotubeapp.com/windowsPhone.html" target="_blank">Metrotube </a> &#8211; One of several youtube apps. WP is able to play them native, but its always good to have a backup ðŸ˜‰

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.shazam.com/" target="_blank">Shazam </a>&#8211; Also legendary. You can record a few seconds of a track and it tells you name and interpret. On Nokia devices you can immediately buy the songs on the Store. Is also able to search the songs directly on youtube.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.skyscanner.ch/" target="_blank">Skyscanner </a> &#8211; A classic one, too. Searches for great and cheap flights.

Nevermind: Its great and it helps me to stay organised (and to not forget anything).

&nbsp;

Do not want to miss it on my trips.

&nbsp;

So, these are just some of my currently running apps. I have a few more but these are not that important ðŸ˜‰

Thanks for reading
