Hey,

today I want to introduce a tool without I could not work in my everyday-coding-life. I always have to work with long paths I can not remember everytime. I got so tired always navigating into the wrong folder, navigating back, once again in another wrong folder and so on only to find the file I was searching for. Stop that!

&#8220;Everything&#8221; is a search-tool which searches for files and folders (NOT the content) incredibly fast. It takes a search filter you type in and as you type you will notice how incredibly fast it searches your files and folders. It immediatelly shows you the result matching to your searchtext after every button you pressed. You have the same context menu as you know it from the Explorer but extended by the options from everything, which are very useful:

![alttext]({{site.baseurl}}assets/images/blogs/2014-03/c366e446-cf69-439d-be7b-b570e90385dc.png)

Everything indexes your files at the very first start and has an immediate update when there is a file change on your computer. Since I know the tool I do not remember any complete files or folders, only the names of it. Searching and opening it with everything is so much easier. Give it a try.
