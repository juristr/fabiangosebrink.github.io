Hey,

I just wanted to delete an old project in my online tfs to keep it clean and up to date. As I noticed that it is not as easy as it sounds, here is the walkthrough:

First get to your normal administration site on the upper right corner.

Then normally you would go to the team administration page and try to delete it:

![alttext]({{site.baseurl}}assets/images/blogs/2014-04/874048f6-0be0-4d2b-b032-02aa182f5f57.png)

But as you see: Even if you are an adminsitrator of the project it is grayed out.

So here is the solution:

If you went to your accounts administration page, do NOT go into a projects-administration site. Choose the collection-administrative site instead!

![alttext]({{site.baseurl}}assets/images/blogs/2014-04/97e130d0-5477-4745-a409-cd53bc3e8c1a.png)

&nbsp;

There you can easily delete your project:

Hope it helps.

Regards.
