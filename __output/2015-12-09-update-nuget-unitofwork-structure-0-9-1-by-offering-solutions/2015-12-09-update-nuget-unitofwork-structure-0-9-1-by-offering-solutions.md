Hey,
  
I just released the UnitOfWork by Offering.Solutions in Version 0.9.1

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/OfferingSolutions.UnitOfWork.Structure/0.9.1">UnitOfWork 0.9.1 on Nuget</a>
</h2>

**This is a breaking change version!!!**

Changes:

  * Beside the &#8220;GetAll&#8221; method is now a &#8220;GetSingle&#8221; instead of &#8220;FindBy&#8221; or something. I wanted the naming to be more consistent because I was confused by myself like all the time.

Please report Bugs if you find some!!

I updated the Github readme and the examples in the repo. Just clone it and let me know what you think ðŸ™‚
  
Regards

&nbsp;

Fabian
