## Introduced Gulp in my AngularJsDemoApp on GitHub

Hey folks,

I just introduced Gulp in my AngularJsDemoApp on GitHub.

Check it out [here](https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/AngularJsDemoApp).

Just run the corresponding gulp commands to start the default gulp task. Or, if you do not like gulp, just comment in all the files explicitly. That will do it, too ðŸ™‚

Regards and have fun. Happy coding

If you have VS 2013 you can install the [Task Runner Explorer](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/8e1b4368-4afb-467a-bc13-9650572db708), which is included in Vs 2015

Fabian
