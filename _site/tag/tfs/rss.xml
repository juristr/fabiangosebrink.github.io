	     <p>In this bogpost I want to show you one possibility of deleting a Team Project on Visual Studio Team Services.</p>

<p>I just stumbled over the case that I wanted to delete an old project in my online TFS to keep it clean and up to date. As I noticed that it is not as easy as it sounds I thought about mentioning it here. So here is the walkthrough:</p>

<p>First log into your VSTS account by typing something like in the browser and entering your username and password.</p>

<pre class="">http://[yourusername].visualstudio.com</pre>

<p>Then navigate to your normal administration site on the upper right corner by selection the rack-wheel.</p>

<p>Then normally you would go to the team administration page and try to delete it:</p>

<p>But as you see: Even if you are an adminsitrator of the project it is grayed out.</p>

<h4>So here is the solution</h4>

<p>If you navigate to your accounts administration page, do NOT go into a projects-administration site. Choose the collection-administrative site instead!</p>

<p>There you can easily delete your project:</p>

<p>I think it is not that easy to delete an existing team project. But to keep the VSTS clean and in good order this might be a useful hint to someone.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>
