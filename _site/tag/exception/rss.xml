	     <p>In this blogpost I want to show you the solution for an error I had today which I spent a lot of time on solving it. it was the case that WPF crashes with OutOfMemoryException when loading PNGs.</p>

<p>I had Windows 8.1 running as operating system and used pngs in my WPF application. It was all running well until I wanted to display the images. The whole programm froze and was unusable. Had to kill the process. I spent a lot of time on this and went through a lot of possibilities to display images in WPF.</p>

<p>It turned out that this is because of indexed and not indexed pngs (You can google the difference). WPF in windows 8.1 can not handle indexed png-files. Open them, save them with RGB (e.g. with Photoshop) and you are done.</p>

<p>You can do Unit Tests with the following function: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.graphics.fromimage.aspx">Graphics.FromImage()</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If the image has an indexed pixel format, this method throws an exception with the message, “A Graphics object cannot be created from an image that has an indexed pixel format.””</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So load all your images with “Graphic.ImageFrom(…)” and see if the exception is thrown to test this.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Regards</p>
