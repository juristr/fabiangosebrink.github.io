	     <p>I am very proud to announce that I will be speaking at the Microsoft TechDays 2017 about Angular and ASP.NET Core.</p>

<p>This is the second time I am attending to the Microsoft TechDays. The last time was 2016 and it was a blast - I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>In my session which is placed as the last one at the second day, I will get you introduced to ASP.NET Core and how to use it. We will look at general facts around ASP.NET Core as well as the Startup-File, Middlewares and of course an ASP.NET Core WebAPI and the implementation of the HTTP-Verbs.</p>

<p>In the second part of my session we will take a look at Angular and one possible way to use components with stateful and stateless design. We will cover the differences between those and find out what One-Way-Dataflow is and how it will help us getting our application cleaner and well structured.</p>

<p>I will prepare an demo application to show all this concepts and techniques in action. We will use Visual Studio Code as this is still a scary thing for many developers due to the fact that it is not Visual Studio itself.</p>

<p>The talk will be in german.</p>

<p>Well, I will do the best I can to give you guys a show, to entertain you and to give you some technical inspiration and a view on this new stuff. I really hope to see you there.</p>

<p>See you</p>

<p>Fabian</p>

<p><img src="/assets/articles/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Feedback.jpg" alt="Feedback" /></p>

<p>Hope to see you again on some events.</p>

<p>Greetings</p>

<p>Fabian</p>

<p>=================</p>

<p>I am so happy to announce that I will speak on the TechDays 2016 in Baden for the first time! I never expected Microsoft to ask me about doing a presentation at this event but they did :) And so I got a slot in the afternoon of the 1st of March. I know this is the last slot of the day and also the end of the TechDays this year but I will do my very best to give you a great technical and entertaining fade-out of this event.</p>

<p>The talks is about Web development with Angular2 in combination with SignalR and we will have a demo working on ASP.NET Core 1.0. I will hold it in german.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know the title shows “ASP.NET 5” but the ASP.NET-Team did the renaming just after I gave Microsoft my title. I will mention that in my talk but just to know: We will of course work with ASP.NET Core 1.0</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://damienbod.com/">DamienBod</a> (many thanks to him at this place) and we will take a look at some pitfalls I discovered and how to avoid them.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there! Looking forward to this!</p>

<p>Fabian</p>
