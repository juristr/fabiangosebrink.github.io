Hey,
  
I just released the UnitOfWork by Offering.Solutions in Version 0.9.1

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/OfferingSolutions.UnitOfWork.Structure/0.9.1">UnitOfWork 0.9.1 on Nuget</a>
</h2>

**This is a breaking change version!!!**

Changes:

  * Beside the "GetAll" method is now a "GetSingle" instead of "FindBy" or something. I wanted the naming to be more consistent because I was confused by myself like all the time.

Please report Bugs if you find some!!

I updated the Github readme and the examples in the repo. Just clone it and let me know what you think.
  
Regards

Fabian
