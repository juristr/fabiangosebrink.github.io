With ASP.NET Core you can build cross platform web apis which I am describing in this course. We dedicated this course to beginners who want to get started but are trying to cover many topics too. All of this is done with Visual Studio 2017. We are going from File - New Project until the deployment in the end.

## Thanks

I could not get this done without some people around.

I want to thank Damien Bowden for reviewing this course. Without him, his feedback, criticism and discussions this course would not be what it is now. Thanks a lot mate (not only for this course).

Next person to thank is Benjamin Abt. In one skype call or another he was there to discuss a lot topics and questions I had. Thank you very much mate. 

Last but not least I want to thank my girlfriend for supporting me while I came from work and went straight to the computer recording until late at night. She had to be quiet most of the time and never complained taking over the private things in our everyday life which I normally do. I think without her I could not have finished this course. She fully understands my passion and has my back all the time. Thank you!
