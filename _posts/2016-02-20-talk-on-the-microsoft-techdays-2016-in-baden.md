I am so happy to announce that I will speak on the TechDays 2016 in Baden for the first time! I never expected Microsoft to ask me about doing a presentation at this event but they did ðŸ™‚ And so I got a slot in the afternoon of the 1st of March. I know this is the last slot of the day and also the end of the TechDays this year but I will do my very best to give you a great technical and entertaining fade-out of this event.

The talks is about Web development with Angular2 in combination with SignalR and we will have a demo working on ASP.NET Core 1.0. I will hold it in german.

> I know the title shows &#8220;<span class="fontColorNormal headline">ASP.NET 5&#8243; but the ASP.NET-Team did the renaming just after I gave Microsoft my title. I will mention that in my talk but just to know: We will of course work with ASP.NET Core 1.0</span>

I will try to get you a introduction into angular2 and how to develop applications with it. I will show how angular2 is build with modules, we will cover dependency injection and databinding in the new version of angular2. After this we will get an idea of SignalR and Typescript and what you can do with this technologies, where to use it and where to not use it! With a few words on ASP.NET Core 1 we will move to a demo I prepared with [[TechDays 2016 Baden](https://www.microsoft.com/de-ch/events/techdays)
