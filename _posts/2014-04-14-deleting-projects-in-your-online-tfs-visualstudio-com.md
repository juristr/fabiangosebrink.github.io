Hey,

I just wanted to delete an old project in my online tfs to keep it clean and up to date. As I noticed that it is not as easy as it sounds, here is the walkthrough:

First get to your normal administration site on the upper right corner.

![Deleting a Team Project on Visual Studio Online / TFS]({{site.baseurl}}assets/articles/2014-04-14/86d30c51-7e99-4f27-b8b9-95dc01d70f34.png)

Then normally you would go to the team administration page and try to delete it:

But as you see: Even if you are an adminsitrator of the project it is grayed out.

So here is the solution:

If you went to your accounts administration page, do NOT go into a projects-administration site. Choose the collection-administrative site instead!

There you can easily delete your project:

Hope it helps.

Regards.
