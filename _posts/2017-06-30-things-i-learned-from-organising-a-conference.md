It has been quiet here for a while... :-) 

You may have noticed that I organised my first conference ".NET Day" about one month ago. Well, that is not true. The organising itself took place long before that but the event took place approximately one month ago. With this distance of time I want to gather up what I learned from organising this event, what I take with me and what will influence the next conference if I will do this again some time :-)

I needed some time to really figure out all the thoughts & things which were going on and break them down to the following points. If you made similar experiences or want to add new ones feel free to comment :)


## Be prepared

## Ask for help

## Delegate

## Change the perspective to an attendee

## Don't do a talk when you organise the conference

## Start early

## Have great topics

## Listen !!!

## Enjoy the moment
