I just released the UnitOfWork by Offering.Solutions in Version 0.8.0.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/OfferingSolutions.UnitOfWork.Structure/0.8.0">Nuget: UnitOfWork by Offering.Solutions 0.8.0</a>
</h3>

Changes:

  * Removed all GetAll-Methods which did return a List. Is all Queryable now.

Have fun
