I am very proud to announce that I will be speaking at the Microsoft TechDays 2017 about Angular and ASP.NET Core.

This is the second time I am attending to the Microsoft TechDays. The last time was 2016 and it was a blast - I really enjoyed it.

In my session which is placed as the last one at the second day, I will get you introduced to ASP.NET Core and how to use it. We will look at general facts around ASP.NET Core as well as the Startup-File, Middlewares and of course an ASP.NET Core WebAPI and the implementation of the HTTP-Verbs.

In the second part of my session we will take a look at Angular and one possible way to use components with stateful and stateless design. We will cover the differences between those and find out what One-Way-Dataflow is and how it will help us getting our application cleaner and well structured.

I will prepare an demo application to show all this concepts and techniques in action. We will use Visual Studio Code as this is still a scary thing for many developers due to the fact that it is not Visual Studio itself.

The talk will be in german.

Well, I will do the best I can to give you guys a show, to entertain you and to give you some technical inspiration and a view on this new stuff. I really hope to see you there.

See you

Fabian
