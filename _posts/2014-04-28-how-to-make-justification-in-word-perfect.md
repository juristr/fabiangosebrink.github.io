Hey,

I just got asked how to erase those big gaps between words when using Microsoft Words justification and this is the solution i came up with:

Just click File &#8211; Options &#8211; Advanced (on the left-hand side)

Now scroll down to the very end of the settings tab and open the compatibility options:

![How to make justification in Word "perfect"]({{site.baseurl}}assets/articles/2014-04-28/0e45d5af-ff44-4feb-87ff-bd2d6b683edf.png)

The option on english ist "Do Full justification the Way WordPerfect 6.x for Windows Does.". click it, close the dialog and it should look better.

Note: If you use Word 2013 this option is gone. If you have an "older" document you can still enable and disable this option but not with a native Word 2013 file. Thanks MS, great work ðŸ˜‰

Regards
