Hey there,

I just wanted to mention that I am now available on GitHub with my personal profile.

I want to publish all my repositories I do code like new trials, hands-on-anythings and examples which will kick you off to get started with what the repository is about.

Feel free to do pull requests and contribute on what I coded.

Sometimes you will find a "_gitAssets"-Folder in my repos which are not for holding anything code specific but they hold pictures or anything used in the readme markdown. Just to ensure the repository is complete I would like to host them directly within the repository.

If anything is not working or not compiling at all please leave me a note bceause every repository shall be possible to get started right away.

Hopefully it helpas anybody for a good start.

Enjoy and HTH

Fabian
